# powershell-cleanup-script
This project automates system cleanup tasks using PowerShell. The script clears user temporary files, Windows update cache, and empties the Recycle Binâ€”simulating common Tier 1 and Tier 2 maintenance actions in a professional IT environment.  Built and tested in a Windows 10 virtual machine as part of my home lab setup.
